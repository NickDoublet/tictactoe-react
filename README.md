Tic Tac Toe React Website

This is a tictactoe game website. There is currently no difference between the vs cpu and vs player modes, there is no cpu opponent programmed in yet. Site is also not yet responsive. Otherwise it functions as a usual tic tac toe game, with a reset button and a banner upon every game end taking you to the main menu or resetting the board and adding to the winning player's points. There is no storage of the points if the page is refreshed.

This project was built with create-react-app. Dependencies include standard react dependencies and react-router. To deploy run npm run build with react and deploy to your platform of choice.
